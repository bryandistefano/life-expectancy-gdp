# Life Expectancy and GDP

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a grasp of data visualization techniques to assess any correlation, positive or negative, between a country's GDP and its citizen's average life expectancy. This project utilizes line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms to explore data from the World Bank and World Health Organization.
